# Databases/Warehouses

Some of the databases and warehouse available when clicking on _Add New Connection_ might require more information than the one shown in the previous section, or could have extra options.

## Redshift

To add a Redshift connection, you will have to provide:

* Connection name, which you will assign to this connection for internal use.
* A JDBC URL. A sample JDBC URL is shown under this text.

> jdbc:redshift://redshift-cluster-1.XXXXXXXXXX.us-east-1.redshift.amazonaws.com:5439/dev?ssl=false

* Credentials, which will be a username and a password that will provide access to this database. 



Optionally, you may provide _s3TempDir_ and _s3AwsIamRole_ for better performance, as explained in the following link.
