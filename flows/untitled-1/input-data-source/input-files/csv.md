* Provide delimiter option if the CSV option is selected.
* Select header from the drop down
* Select if schema should be inferred,
  * Note : If the input file size is large &gt; 20mb, it is recommended not to select infer schema as true.
* Click on "Validate", At this point, the csv file is validated and if successful, sample records are fetched. Check the "Sample Data" tab to ensure the file parsing is successful and data is as expected.
