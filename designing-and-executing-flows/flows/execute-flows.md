# Execute Flows

There are two main ways to execute flows in TestingWhizPro:

1. When a new flow is created, click on the _Save_ button, after naming the flow, and then click on the _Execute_ button. The flow will be executed and added to the _Flows _and _Executions_ tabs.
2. In the _Flows_ tab, a user can check the _Action_ boxes of as many flows as desired and then click on the _Execute Batch _button. These flows will be added to the _Executions_ tab.
