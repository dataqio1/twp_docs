# Remove Duplicate

The _Remove Duplicate_ shape is used to remove the columns from the incoming table that are a duplicate, which is to say, if the tables include information that is presented more than once. This component has to be connected between the data _Source _or _Target_ whose duplicates are to be removed, and another component.
