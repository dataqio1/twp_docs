# Filter Rows

The _Filter Rows _shape can be used to filter the incoming data by writing an SQL rule. This component has to be connected between the data _Source _or _Target_ that is to be filtered, and another component.

* After dragging the component to the canvas and making the appropriate connections, click on the _Filter Rows_ component to open the option's windows.
* Select the table to which the filter will be applied from the dropdown menu.
* Write the SQL rule in the designated box and click on _Apply SQL_.
* A list of the available rows will be shown on the right side of the window.
* Click on _Save_ to save the changes.
