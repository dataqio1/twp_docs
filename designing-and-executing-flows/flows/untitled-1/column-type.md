# Column Type

The _Column Type_ shape can be used to change the type of the information of the columns in each of the selected tables. The available types of data for the columns are:

* Long
* Integer
* Short
* Float
* Double
* Decimal
* Byte
* Boolean
* String
* Extract_JSON_flatten

This component has to be connected between the data _Source _or _Target_ whose column type is to be changed, and another component.
