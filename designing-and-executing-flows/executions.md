# Executions

The _Executions _tab will show the current status of all the executed flows. This area will also display:

* The top of the screen will show the number of executions that have been passed and the number of executions that have failed.
* The list of flows contains the _BatchId_ and _Batch Execution Id_, which identify the batch to which a flow belongs and the ID of each specific flow.
* The list will also show the name, time of execution, and status of each test case.
* From this interface, users can execute again or delete a flow, by clicking on the _Execute_ or _Delete_ buttons on each row, respectively.
